## Welcome to my GitHub Page


## A little bit about myself:

I'd like to take some time to write about myself. 
I am somewhat of a late bloomer. In the past, I often got complemented on my intelligence 
but I never really took it upon myself to do anything with my life. This was due to my,
lack of interest in school. At the time, I couldn't care less about most of what was 
taught in high-school. Rather, I was far more interested in video games. I would often
try creating many of my own and using various methods (some of which involved coding).
However, I never really dove deep into coding until my late twenties. At twentyfive, 
I finally decided I needed to get my priorities set straight (a couple of "puppy love"
heart breakes will do that to a young lad). I went to community college and got an 
associates in liberal arts. After that, I realized that it was logic that always kept
my interest. Creating things from code and bringing them to life, yeah, that's what
I wanted to do. So, here I am! A few semesters in BSU as a CS major in hopes of 
rewritting the world, one line at a time.

Now that you have an idea of me and where I am coming from, why not check out some of my work? Click the
